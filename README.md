# BIA_Project
This is a project on Stellar Object Classification
ðŸš€ Project Overview
Classifying stellar objects, such as stars, galaxies, and quasars, is crucial in astronomical studies. This project applies multiple supervised learning algorithms to detect and classify stellar objects efficiently. The best-performing model, XGBoost, was deployed on Streamlit to provide real-time predictions.
