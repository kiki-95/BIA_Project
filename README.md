Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying celestial objectsâ€”stars, galaxies, and quasars (luminous supermassive black holes)â€”based on their spectral characteristics. By leveraging machine learning, we aim to analyze spectral data to extract meaningful insights, enabling a deeper understanding of the universe's structure and evolution.

Introduction

Astronomy involves studying objects beyond Earth's atmosphere, such as stars, galaxies, and quasars. Spectral classification is a crucial tool for understanding the properties of these objects, including their composition, temperature, and magnetic fields. This project uses machine learning models to classify celestial objects based on spectral data, contributing to a more profound comprehension of the cosmos.

Dataset

Source: [Insert Dataset Source Here, e.g., Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)]

Features:

Spectral data (e.g., flux, wavelength)

Object types (stars, galaxies, quasars)

Additional properties like redshift and magnitudes

Preprocessing Steps:

Cleaning missing or inconsistent values

Normalizing spectral features

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

3. Dataset Overview ðŸ“Š
   The dataset used in this project contains 100,000 observations of space captured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Each data point consists of 17 feature columns and 1 class column, which identifies the 
   object as either a star, galaxy, or quasar.

  Note: The SDSS data is publicly available. Please refer to the citation at the end for more information


  4. **ðŸ“Š Models Used**
      The following machine learning models were implemented and compared:
       1. Decision Tree
       2. Random Forest
       3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
       4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
       5. Gradient Boosting
       6. AdaBoost
       7.  XGBoost


XGBoost demonstrated superior performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall compared to other models.
