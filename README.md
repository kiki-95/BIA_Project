Project Overview ðŸ”­
1. Introduction ðŸŒŸ
Astronomy is the study of everything in the universe beyond Earthâ€™s atmosphere. Astronomers classify stars based on their spectral characteristics, helping to extract valuable information about the stars, such as their elements, temperature, density, and magnetic field. The classification of celestial objects, including stars, galaxies, and quasars, is a fundamental task in astronomy.This project aims to classify stars, galaxies, and quasars (luminous supermassive black holes) based on their spectral characteristics. The classification scheme plays a critical role in understanding the structure and evolution of the universe.

3. Dataset Overview ðŸ“Š
   The dataset used in this project contains 100,000 observations of space captured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Each data point consists of 17 feature columns and 1 class column, which identifies the 
   object as either a star, galaxy, or quasar.

  Note: The SDSS data is publicly available. Please refer to the citation at the end for more information


  4. **ðŸ“Š Models Used**
      The following machine learning models were implemented and compared:
       1. Decision Tree
       2. Random Forest
       3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
       4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
       5. Gradient Boosting
       6. AdaBoost
       7.  XGBoost


XGBoost demonstrated superior performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall compared to other models.
